Zyra Bulk Image Optimization — Full Improvement Plan

Goal:
➡ Select products →
➡ Zyra auto-checks images →
➡ Optimizes alt-text for all images →
➡ If any product has NO image, Zyra warns user →
➡ All optimized results appear in “Optimized Products” page.

Everything automated.

⭐ PHASE 1 — Selecting Products (UI Upgrade)
When user selects:

5, 20, 50, 100 products
→ Zyra opens a Bulk Image Optimization Modal.

The modal shows:

Product	Image Count	Status
USB Flash Drive	4 images	Ready
Smart Speaker	0 images	❌ Missing
Bag	3 images	Ready

If any product has 0 images, Zyra will show:

🔴 “This product has no images. Please upload at least 1 image before optimization.”

User can:

Remove the product

Or go to Shopify directly

Or skip missing images

⭐ PHASE 2 — Zyra Auto-Checks Image Availability

Behind the scenes:

Zyra fetches all product images from Shopify:
GET /admin/api/2024-07/products/<id>.json

For each product:

If images.length > 0 → mark as Ready

If images.length = 0 → mark as Missing

Missing images are shown in UI.

Zyra intelligently handles:

✔ Multiple images
✔ Variants images
✔ Media (photos/videos)
✔ Alt-text existing or blank

⭐ PHASE 3 — Bulk Job Creation (Database Layer)

Create a job in Supabase:

bulk_image_jobs
- job_id
- user_id
- total_products
- status


And entries:

bulk_image_job_items
- item_id
- job_id
- product_id
- image_list[]
- status (pending/processing/done/missing_image)


Missing image products get status: missing_image immediately.

They are not processed.

⭐ PHASE 4 — AI Vision + SEO Alt-Text Engine

For each image, Zyra runs:

✔ Step 1 — AI Vision Understanding

Detect:

Object

Material

Color

Size

Use-case

Photography style

Key attributes

Variant detail

✔ Step 2 — SEO Alt-Text Generation

Creates alt-text like:

“Black waterproof laptop backpack with USB charging port — front view on white background.”

The AI includes:

Primary keyword

Product name

Color/variant

Category-specific terms

Google image SEO intent

Accessibility-friendly phrasing

✔ Step 3 — Cleanup Rules

Alt-text is always:

10–18 words

No emojis

No full stops

Keyword-rich but natural

No repetition

No stuffing

No SKU or long numbers

⭐ PHASE 5 — Worker Processes Images in Batches
Batch logic:

Each batch handles 3–5 products

Each product may have 1–10 images

Optimal: 15–30 images processed per minute

Worker does:

Fetch pending items

For each image:

Run AI vision + text

Save results to Supabase

Update product alt-text in Shopify (optional)

Mark as done

Smart improvements:

✔ Retry on failure
✔ Skip images that already have high-quality alt-text
✔ Group similar products (cost saving)
✔ Use GPT-4o-mini for speed

⭐ PHASE 6 — Missing Image Auto-Handling

For any product with no images:

Zyra stores:

status = "missing_image"
reason = "This product has no images. Add image to continue optimization."


And then in UI → highlight:

🔴 “Missing image – add at least 1 image.”

User can click:
Add Image → opens Shopify Media upload page.

⭐ PHASE 7 — Optimized Results → “Optimized Products” Page

Once processing finishes, Zyra stores alt-text results:

image_optimization_history
- product_id
- image_id
- old_alt
- new_alt
- created_at


On “Optimized Products” page:

Show:
Product	Images Optimized	New Alt-Text Preview	Status	Applied to Shopify

Buttons:

View Details

Copy Alt-Text

Re-Optimize

Apply All to Shopify

⭐ PHASE 8 — Shopify Apply

When user clicks Apply All:

Zyra uses:

GraphQL → mediaImageUpdate mutation

Updates:

New alt-text

Keeps other media metadata intact

If multiple images → Zyra updates all.

⭐ PHASE 9 — User Feedback & Notifications

During optimization Zyra shows:

🔵 Working…
🟡 Processing 3/12 products
🟢 Completed
🔴 Missing images (view list)

Notifications:

“Bulk Image Optimization Completed”

“3 Products need images”

“15 Alt-Texts updated successfully”

⭐ PHASE 10 — Cost Optimization (Important)

For 100 products with 2 images each → 200 images.

Using GPT-4o-mini (vision) → very cheap.

Recommended:

Image dispatch in batches

Reuse product keywords across all images

Cache category keywords

Skip re-opt if quality score is already good
