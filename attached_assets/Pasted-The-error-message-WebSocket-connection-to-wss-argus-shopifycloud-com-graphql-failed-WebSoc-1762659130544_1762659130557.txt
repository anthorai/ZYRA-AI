The error message "WebSocket connection to 'wss://argus.shopifycloud.com/graphql?...' failed: WebSocket is closed before the connection is established" indicates that the browser attempted to open a WebSocket connection, but before the handshake process could complete and the connection become fully established, the WebSocket was unexpectedly closed. This can happen for several reasons, such as network issues, server-side rejections (e.g., due to invalid authentication, authorization, or rate limiting), or client-side code immediately closing the connection after attempting to open it. In this specific case, the stack trace points to S.closeWebsocket and S.close being called, suggesting that the application itself might be prematurely closing the connection.The console error "WebSocket connection to 'wss://argus.shopifycloud.com/graphql?bucket_id=gid://shopify/Shop/59624161344' failed: WebSocket is closed before the connection is established" indicates that the browser attempted to open a WebSocket connection, but before the handshake process could complete and establish a stable connection, the WebSocket was unexpectedly closed. This often happens due to network issues (e.g., temporary loss of internet, firewall blocking the connection, or a server-side issue that immediately rejects the connection), or if the client-side code explicitly closes the connection very shortly after initiating it. In this specific stack trace, the S.closeWebsocket and S.close methods are involved, suggesting that the application's code is attempting to close the WebSocket prematurely.The warning using deprecated parameters for the initialization function; pass a single object instead indicates that a function in your code, likely an initialization function, is being called with multiple individual arguments (parameters) that are no longer the recommended way to pass configuration or options. The modern and preferred approach, as suggested by the warning, is to group these individual parameters into a single JavaScript object and pass that object as the sole argument to the function. This pattern improves readability, maintainability, and makes the API more flexible for future changes without breaking existing calls.

The stack trace points to main-CCUDLeqI.js:2 as the source of the console.warn call, and further up the stack, EA and s in loaders-common-CotXkscaZ-67.js:43 seem to be involved in the initialization process. This suggests that a function within loaders-common-CotXkscaZ-67.js or main-CCUDLeqI.js is being initialized with deprecated parameters.
