Upgrade Existing CSV Import / Export (Zyra AI)
CONTEXT

Zyra AI already has a working CSV Import / Export feature used for bulk product management and data synchronization.

Your task is NOT to rebuild or replace it, but to upgrade and extend the existing feature with modern, premium value while keeping current workflows stable.

🎯 UPDATE OBJECTIVE

Update the current CSV Import / Export feature so it:

Remains backward-compatible with existing CSV workflows

Adds intelligence, safety, and scale value

Feels like a premium bulk-control system, not a basic file tool

Requires no manual writing from users

📁 FILE FORMAT UPDATE (EXTEND, DON’T BREAK)

Keep existing CSV support exactly as-is.

Add support for:

XLSX (.xlsx) import and export

Internally convert XLSX → CSV

Processing logic must still operate on CSV internally

Do NOT add any other file formats.

🧠 PRE-IMPORT INTELLIGENCE (NEW LAYER)

Before applying an imported file, add a non-destructive validation step:

Validate required fields (handle, title, description)

Detect duplicate handles or titles

Detect keyword conflicts across products

Identify missing SEO-critical fields

Flag risky updates that may affect store-level consistency

This step must:

Show a read-only validation summary

NOT apply changes automatically

Allow user to continue or cancel

⚙️ BULK APPLY UPGRADE (KEEP EXISTING APPLY FLOW)

When user confirms:

Apply changes using the existing bulk apply logic

Enhance it by:

Grouping products logically (category / intent where possible)

Respecting Multimodal AI strategy decisions

Apply changes instantly to products (no push step)

🔐 ROLLBACK INTEGRATION (CONNECT, DON’T DUPLICATE)

Integrate the existing CSV flow with Zyra’s current Rollback system:

Automatically save a pre-import snapshot

Register the import as a rollback event

Allow revert by:

Full import

Product group

Single product

Do NOT build a new rollback system.

🖥️ UX UPDATE (MINIMAL & SAFE)

Update UI behavior so that:

CSV Import clearly shows:

Validation summary

“Safe to apply / Needs attention” states

No new manual input fields are introduced

Existing users can continue using CSV without friction

🚫 HARD CONSTRAINTS (DO NOT CHANGE)

Do NOT remove existing CSV behavior

Do NOT add manual writing or prompt inputs

Do NOT generate SEO or content inside CSV logic

Do NOT add ranking, revenue, or performance claims

Do NOT bypass Multimodal AI decisions

📌 UPDATED FEATURE DESCRIPTION (REPLACE OLD ONE)

CSV Import/Export lets you safely sync, review, and manage products in bulk—with built-in validation and rollback protection for large-scale optimization.

🔑 INTERNAL UPDATE PRINCIPLE

Upgrade the system’s intelligence and safety without changing how users already trust it.
