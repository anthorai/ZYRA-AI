YOU ARE ZYRA AI.

TASK:
Create a single unified “Change Control Dashboard”
that gives merchants full visibility, control, and proof
over every AI-driven change made by ZYRA
without breaking the core revenue loop.

====================================================
CORE PRINCIPLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
====================================================

This dashboard must NOT be a generic editor.

It is a:
- Decision review system
- Execution control panel
- Revenue proof system

Every item shown must map to:
DETECT → DECIDE → EXECUTE → PROVE → LEARN

====================================================
DASHBOARD PURPOSE
====================================================

The dashboard must allow merchants to:
1. See WHAT ZYRA wants to change
2. See WHY ZYRA wants to change it
3. See BEFORE vs AFTER clearly
4. Approve or reject changes
5. Auto-apply or manually apply changes
6. Instantly rollback any change
7. See revenue impact of each change

====================================================
DASHBOARD STRUCTURE (SINGLE PAGE)
====================================================

SECTION 1: CHANGE TIMELINE (TOP)

- Chronological list of all ZYRA actions
- Each item shows:
  • Product name + thumbnail
  • Action type (SEO, Content, Discoverability, Recovery)
  • Status badge:
    - Pending Approval
    - Applied
    - Rolled Back
    - Monitoring Impact
  • Risk level (Low / Medium / High)
  • Manual / Autonomous badge

----------------------------------------------------

SECTION 2: CHANGE DETAIL PANEL (ON SELECT)

For the selected change, show:

A) DECISION CONTEXT
- Why this product
- Why this change
- Expected revenue impact
- Confidence score
- Risk explanation (plain language)

----------------------------------------------------

B) BEFORE / AFTER COMPARISON (CORE FEATURE)

Show side-by-side comparison for:
- Product Title
- Product Description
- SEO Title
- Meta Description
- Image Alt Text
- Tags / Keywords (if applicable)

UI REQUIREMENTS:
- Left = BEFORE (read-only)
- Right = AFTER (highlighted changes)
- Inline diff highlighting
- Clean, modern typography
- Dark mode compatible

----------------------------------------------------

C) EXECUTION CONTROLS

Buttons (context-aware):

IF PENDING:
- [Approve & Push to Shopify]
- [Edit Before Pushing] (optional manual tweak)
- [Reject Change]

IF APPLIED:
- [Rollback Instantly]
- [Lock Change]

IF AUTOPILOT ENABLED:
- Badge: “Auto-applied by ZYRA”
- Rollback always available

----------------------------------------------------

SECTION 3: REVENUE PROOF PANEL

After execution, show:

- Revenue delta (₹ / $)
- Orders influenced
- Timeline:
  Decision → Execution → Result
- Status:
  • Impact Building
  • Positive Impact
  • Negative Impact (Rollback Suggested)

IMPORTANT:
No vanity metrics.
No CTR.
No impressions.
Only money.

----------------------------------------------------

SECTION 4: SAFETY & CONTROL SETTINGS

Per store / per product:
- Enable / disable autopilot
- Autonomy level (Low-risk only / All except high-risk)
- Auto-rollback threshold
- Manual approval required toggle

====================================================
ROLLBACK SYSTEM (CRITICAL)
====================================================

Every applied change MUST:
- Store a full snapshot of original content
- Allow rollback in one click
- Log rollback reason
- Restore Shopify state instantly

Rollback must NOT:
- Break loop
- Reset learning
- Lose history

====================================================
LOOP INTEGRATION RULES
====================================================

This dashboard must NOT create a new workflow.

Rules:
- DETECT creates the opportunity
- DECIDE creates the change proposal
- DASHBOARD is the REVIEW & CONTROL layer
- EXECUTE happens only after approval or autopilot rule
- PROVE updates dashboard with revenue impact
- LEARN updates future confidence scores

Dashboard is a WINDOW into the loop, not a replacement.

====================================================
UI LANGUAGE RULES
====================================================

Use business language, not technical language.

Examples:
- “Why ZYRA recommends this”
- “What will change”
- “Expected revenue impact”
- “Safe to apply / Requires review”
- “Undo change instantly”

====================================================
EXPECTED RESULT
====================================================

Merchants should feel:
- Safe
- In control
- Confident
- Informed

ZYRA should feel like:
A senior growth manager making explainable decisions.

====================================================
FINAL CHECK
====================================================

This dashboard must:
- Increase trust
- Reduce fear of automation
- Increase approval rate
- Reduce churn
- Justify premium pricing

If any feature does NOT support revenue confidence,
it must be removed.
