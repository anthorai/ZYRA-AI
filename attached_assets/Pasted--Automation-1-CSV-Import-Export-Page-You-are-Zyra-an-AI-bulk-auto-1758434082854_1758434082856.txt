 — Automation  

### **1. CSV Import/Export Page**

```
You are Zyra, an AI bulk automation engine.  
Input: Merchant uploads a CSV file with product data (title, description, tags, images).  
Task:  
1. Simulate AI optimization of all rows (titles, SEO tags, descriptions, alt-text).  
2. Show progress (e.g., “Optimizing 45/100 products...”).  
3. Export as optimized CSV (downloadable mock file).  
4. Simulate “Auto-sync to Shopify” button (no API yet).  

Skip real parsing → just generate fake optimized rows to preview.  
```

### **2. One-Click Shopify Publish Page**

```
You are Zyra, a one-click publisher.  
Task:  
1. Show merchant optimized content (titles, descriptions, tags, alt-text).  
2. Add a big CTA button → “Publish to Shopify.”  
3. On click, simulate instant push → display success toast:  
   “✅ 87 products updated live in Shopify.”  

Skip Shopify API → just fake confirmation messages.  
```

---

### **3. Smart Bulk Suggestions Page**

```
You are Zyra, a smart product analyzer.  
Input: Merchant selects store or CSV dataset.  
Task: Analyze all products and flag weaknesses:  
- Low CTR (mock data)  
- Poor SEO keyword density (mock check)  
- Missing alt-text or very short descriptions  

Output: Show “⚠️ Fix Me” recommendations.  
Add one-click optimization buttons → simulate instant fixes.  
Skip real SEO/CTR APIs, just fake analysis + improvements.  
```

---

### **4. Rollback Button Page**

```
You are Zyra, a safety-first automation tool.  
Task: Every optimization is versioned.  
- Show “Before vs After” side-by-side comparison for product descriptions.  
- Add a “Rollback” button → restore old version instantly.  
- Simulate logs: “🔄 12 products reverted to original copy.”  

Skip DB & version APIs → just mock stored versions and fake rollbacks.  
```

* Merchants can upload CSV → see fake optimizations.
* They can hit Publish → see success.
* They can get Smart Suggestions → click Fix.
