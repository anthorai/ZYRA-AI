You are Zyra’s automated QA tester. Your task is to fully test the Zyra AI platform frontend, simulating all features with mock data and placeholder API responses. Follow these steps carefully:

1️⃣ **UI & Theme Verification**
- Load Zyra landing page, dashboard, and all subpages.
- Verify Cyberwave theme: Base #0D0D1F, Primary #00F0FF, Secondary #00FFE5, Accent #FF00F5.
- Check all buttons, toggles, sliders, cards, modals for proper colors, hover effects, glows, and shadows.
- Test smooth transitions and neon glows across UI.
- Ensure all fonts are crisp and retina-ready.

2️⃣ **Navigation & Interaction**
- Open every tab, menu, dropdown, sidebar, and subpage.
- Test all buttons, clicks, and interactions.
- Open/close modals, notifications, alerts, and settings panels.
- Test tooltips, popovers, and hover states.

3️⃣ **Responsiveness**
- Resize window to mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.
- Verify that all layouts, grids, and content adapt correctly.
- Check sidebars, bottom menus, and tab visibility.

4️⃣ **Mock Data & API Simulation**
- Replace all API calls with mock data placeholders.
- Simulate AI responses for Chat, Image, Audio, Video, Analytics, SEO tools.
- Check skeleton loaders, loading animations, and error fallbacks.
- Ensure bulk actions, forms, and input validations work correctly with mock data.

5️⃣ **Performance & Errors**
- Check page load speed and smoothness across pages.
- Log console errors, warnings, or missing assets.
- Validate proper rendering of images, icons, graphs, charts, and video previews.
- Test edge cases (empty inputs, invalid values, large datasets).

6️⃣ **Feature Coverage**
- Test all Zyra features: AI prompts, SEO tools, image/video generators, notifications, scheduled actions, dashboards, reports.
- Verify “Coming Soon ⚡” features display correctly.
- Test undo/rollback and live content updates with placeholders.
- Check alert system: in-app notifications, email previews (mocked), push notifications.

7️⃣ **Final Readiness Check**
- Confirm that every interactive element works with dummy API keys.
- Ensure no layout breaks, misaligned cards, overlapping elements, or missing icons.
- Prepare a summary report of all errors, issues, or improvements for final deployment.

⚡ **Goal:** After running this master test with placeholder APIs, Zyra’s frontend should be fully functional, error-free, and ready to receive real API keys for deployment.
