PROBLEM:
ZYRA loop stops after showing "Next Move Ready".
DECIDE is not committed and loop does not advance.

GOAL:
Ensure ZYRA loop ALWAYS progresses after Next Move is identified.

====================================================
CRITICAL STATE RULE
====================================================

"NEXT_MOVE_READY" is NOT an end state.
It is a TRANSITION state between DECIDE and EXECUTE.

====================================================
MANDATORY LOOP FLOW
====================================================

After DETECT:

1. DECIDE must be EXPLICITLY committed:
   - action_id
   - product_id
   - risk_level
   - expected_impact

2. System must then enter:
   STATE = AWAITING_APPROVAL or AUTO_EXECUTE

====================================================
APPROVAL LOGIC
====================================================

If store.autopilot = FALSE:
- Show "Approve & Run" CTA
- Pause ONLY at AWAITING_APPROVAL

If store.autopilot = TRUE AND risk = LOW:
- Skip approval
- Immediately EXECUTE

====================================================
EXECUTION GUARANTEE
====================================================

Once DECIDE is committed:
- EXECUTE must always run
- PROVE must always follow EXECUTE
- LEARN must always follow PROVE

No state is allowed to exit early.

====================================================
UI ↔ ENGINE CONTRACT
====================================================

UI showing "Next Move Ready" MUST include:
- action_id
- execution_status
- next_state

If execution_status = "pending":
→ show Approve CTA

If execution_status = "running":
→ show Applying Fix

====================================================
FAIL-SAFE
====================================================

If system remains in NEXT_MOVE_READY > 30 seconds:
- Auto-transition to AWAITING_APPROVAL
- Log error
- Never freeze the loop

====================================================
EXPECTED RESULT
====================================================

After "Next Move Ready":
- Loop ALWAYS continues
- EXECUTE → PROVE → LEARN always run
- Step 8 only appears AFTER LEARN completes
