YOU ARE A SENIOR FULL-STACK ENGINEER BUILDING ZYRA AI.

TASK:
Build a modern, revenue-focused “ZYRA Report Page” that shows
how ZYRA’s AI decisions impacted a Shopify store’s revenue
without breaking the core loop:

DETECT → DECIDE → EXECUTE → PROVE → LEARN

This page must NOT be a generic analytics dashboard.

====================================================
CORE PURPOSE (MANDATORY)
====================================================

The report page must answer ONE question clearly:

“What money did ZYRA make, protect, or influence for this store?”

If a component does not support this question,
DO NOT BUILD IT.

====================================================
PAGE TYPE
====================================================

- Read-only page
- No actions triggered from here
- Reflects completed loop cycles only
- Uses existing ZYRA decision & execution logs

====================================================
PAGE STRUCTURE (IMPLEMENT EXACTLY)
====================================================

-----------------------------------------
SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (TOP)
-----------------------------------------

Create a summary card that shows:

- Total Revenue Impact (₹ / $)
- Revenue Gained
- Revenue Protected (via rollback)
- Net Impact

Text:
“Based on ZYRA’s automated revenue decisions”

NO charts here.
Large numbers only.

-----------------------------------------
SECTION 2: DECISION → RESULT TIMELINE
-----------------------------------------

Create a vertical timeline list.

Each item must include:
- Product thumbnail + name
- Decision summary (what ZYRA changed)
- Reason for decision (plain language)
- Manual / Autonomous badge
- Risk level badge
- Revenue result:
  - Positive
  - Neutral
  - Rolled back (loss prevented)

Each item must map clearly to:
DETECT → DECIDE → EXECUTE → PROVE

-----------------------------------------
SECTION 3: BEFORE / AFTER SNAPSHOTS
-----------------------------------------

For high-impact decisions, show:

Side-by-side comparison:
- Product Title
- Description
- SEO Title
- Meta Description
- Image Alt Text

Include:
- Revenue before
- Revenue after
- Revenue delta

UI:
- Left = Before (read-only)
- Right = After (highlight changes)

-----------------------------------------
SECTION 4: WHAT ZYRA LEARNED
-----------------------------------------

Summarize learnings in human language.

Examples:
- “Benefit-first titles convert better for this store”
- “SEO improvements work best on Product Type X”

These insights must come from LEARN stage data.

-----------------------------------------
SECTION 5: CURRENT STORE STATE
-----------------------------------------

Show ONE state only:

- Preparing for Growth
- Actively Protecting Revenue
- Expanding Discoverability Safely

This reassures the merchant ZYRA is always working.

-----------------------------------------
SECTION 6: NEXT EXPECTED VALUE
-----------------------------------------

Display what ZYRA is monitoring next.

Example:
“Monitoring Product A for potential upsell opportunity”

NO promises.
NO execution buttons.

====================================================
ABSOLUTE RESTRICTIONS
====================================================

DO NOT BUILD:
- CTR metrics
- Open rates
- Keyword rankings
- Traffic graphs
- Advanced filters
- Editable controls

If it causes analysis paralysis, remove it.

====================================================
UI / UX REQUIREMENTS
====================================================

- Modern, premium SaaS UI
- Dark mode compatible
- Clear typography
- Minimal charts (only revenue-linked)
- Business language, not technical language

====================================================
DATA SOURCES
====================================================

Use:
- ZYRA decision logs
- Execution history
- Revenue attribution records
- Rollback logs
- Learning summaries

DO NOT fetch raw Shopify analytics directly here.

====================================================
FINAL CHECK
====================================================

After viewing this page, the merchant must think:

“ZYRA clearly earned its subscription.”
“If I turn this off, I lose clarity and protection.”

If the page does not create confidence,
iterate until it does.
