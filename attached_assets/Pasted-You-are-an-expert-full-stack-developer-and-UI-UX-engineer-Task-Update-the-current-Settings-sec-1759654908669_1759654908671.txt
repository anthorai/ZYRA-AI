You are an expert full-stack developer and UI/UX engineer.

Task:
Update the current Settings section of the application.

Objective:
When a user clicks on any of the following setting cards:
1. AI Preferences  
2. Notifications & Alerts  
3. Integrations  
4. Security  
5. Support & Resources  

→ Instead of redirecting or opening a new page, it should open a **small centered popup window (modal)** within the same screen.

Popup Window Behavior:
- Each popup should display that card’s **functions, features, and controls** in a compact layout.  
- The popup must appear smoothly with a fade + scale animation.  
- Include a **close button (X)** at the top-right corner that closes the popup.  
- The background behind the popup should slightly blur when active.  
- Prevent background scrolling when the popup is open.  
- Each popup content should be dynamically loaded based on which card is clicked.

Functional Flow:
1. Delete any existing modal or redirection logic currently applied to these cards.  
2. Add a new `SettingsModal` component that receives props:
   - `isOpen` (boolean)
   - `onClose` (function)
   - `contentType` (string: “ai”, “notifications”, “integrations”, “security”, “support”)  
3. When a card is clicked:
   - Update state to set the corresponding `contentType`.
   - Open the modal dynamically with relevant content.

Content Guidelines:
- AI Preferences: show dropdowns, toggles, and sliders for AI behavior control.  
- Notifications & Alerts: show switches for enabling/snoozing notifications.  
- Integrations: show buttons or connection status for APIs or tools.  
- Security: show password change, 2FA toggle, and session list mock.  
- Support & Resources: show help center links and contact support form mock.  

Implementation:
- Use a shared state (`useState` or global context`) to manage open/close and type.  
- Use clean, minimal UI with proper spacing and readable typography.  
- Keep component responsive and centered for all screen sizes.  
- Ensure modals can be extended easily with more cards in future.  

Output:
Provide the complete updated React (Next.js compatible) code including:
- `SettingsPage` component
- `SettingsModal` reusable component
- Example `useState` logic for open/close handling
- Mock data or sample features for each popup category
- Smooth transitions for modal entry and exit
