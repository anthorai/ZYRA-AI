# ✅ Recent Fixes Applied

## Date: November 21, 2025

### 1. Fixed "Coming Soon" Message on Dashboard Cards ✅

**Issue:** Cart Recovery and AI Optimization cards on the Growth Dashboard were showing "Coming Soon" toast messages when clicked.

**Root Cause:** The `handleAnalyticsAction` function in `growth-dashboard.tsx` didn't have route mappings for these cards. When clicked, they fell through to the default "Coming Soon" handler.

**Solution Applied:**
- Added route mapping for `cart-recovery` → `/cart-recovery`
- Added route mapping for `ai-optimization` → `/products`
- Both cards now navigate to their respective functional pages

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/components/dashboard/growth-dashboard.tsx`

**Result:** ✅ Cards now work correctly and navigate to actual feature pages instead of showing "Coming Soon" messages.

### 2. Fixed OpenAI Streaming Error Messages ✅

**Issue:** AI copywriting feature showed confusing "Stream ended unexpectedly without completion" error instead of the actual OpenAI error message.

**Root Cause:** Frontend SSE (Server-Sent Events) error handler wasn't properly capturing and displaying error messages from the backend.

**Solution Applied:**
- Updated SSE stream handler to capture error messages before cleanup
- Store error message in variable when `type: 'error'` is received
- Mark stream as completed gracefully
- Throw actual error message after cleanup

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/pages/ai-tools/professional-copywriting.tsx`

**Result:** ✅ Users now see clear, helpful error messages like:
```
❌ Generation failed
Rate limit reached for gpt-4o-mini: Limit 3, Used 3, Requested 1.
Please try again in 20s.
```

### 3. Multi-Currency Display Implementation ✅

**Issue:** ROI dashboard displayed all revenue in USD regardless of merchant's store currency.

**Solution Applied:**
- ✅ Added `currency` field to `store_connections` database schema
- ✅ Updated Shopify OAuth callback to fetch and save store currency
- ✅ Created `formatCurrency()` utility function for consistent formatting
- ✅ Updated API responses to include currency in ROI/analytics data
- ✅ Updated frontend components to use dynamic currency formatting
- ✅ Fixed Supabase storage layer to properly map currency field

**Files Modified:**
- `shared/schema.ts`
- `server/routes.ts`
- `server/lib/supabase-storage.ts`
- `client/src/lib/utils.ts`
- `client/src/hooks/use-roi-summary.ts`
- `client/src/components/dashboard/roi-summary-card.tsx`

**Result:** ✅ ROI dashboard now displays revenue in merchant's native currency:
- Indian stores: ₹847.50
- US stores: $847.50
- European stores: €847.50
- UK stores: £847.50

### 4. Fixed Database Schema Errors ✅

**Issue:** Missing `revenue_attribution` table causing "Payment System Error" crashes.

**Solution Applied:**
- Ran `npx drizzle-kit push` to synchronize database schema
- Created missing `revenue_attribution` table
- Verified all ROI tracking endpoints work correctly

**Result:** ✅ No more database errors, all ROI tracking functionality works.

## ⚠️ Known Issues & User Actions Required

### OpenAI API Rate Limit (User Action Required)

**Issue:** OpenAI free tier only allows 3 requests per minute, which is too restrictive for AI features.

**User Action Required:**
1. Visit https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. Add payment method (credit/debit card)
3. Set usage limit ($20-50/month recommended)
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for changes to apply
5. Test AI features again

**Expected Cost:** Very low! ~$0.001 per product description (less than 1 cent)

**After Fix:** Rate limit increases from 3 → 200 requests/min (66x more!)
