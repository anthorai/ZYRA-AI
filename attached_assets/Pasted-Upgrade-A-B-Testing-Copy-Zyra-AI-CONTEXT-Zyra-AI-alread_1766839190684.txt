Upgrade A/B Testing Copy (Zyra AI)
CONTEXT

Zyra AI already has an A/B Testing Copy feature that tests different versions of product copy.

Your task is NOT to remove or redesign it, but to upgrade the existing feature so it becomes automatic, safer, smarter, and more valuable, aligned with Zyra AI’s goal of organic Google-driven sales growth.

🎯 UPDATE OBJECTIVE

Update the current A/B Testing Copy feature so it:

Requires zero manual writing

Runs automatically and safely

Tests strategies, not random text

Protects sales during testing

Learns and improves results store-wide

Integrates with Zyra’s Rollback system

🧠 TESTING LOGIC UPGRADE (CORE CHANGE)

Replace basic “Version A vs Version B” logic with strategy-based testing:

Generate copy variants based on different conversion strategies, such as:

SEO + clarity focused

Benefit-first conversion focused

Trust & reassurance focused

Urgency-light CTA focused

Variants must:

Stay SEO-safe

Respect Brand Voice Memory

Align with product images and intent

Be approved automatically (no user prompts)

🛡️ ZERO-RISK TESTING RULES (NEW)

To protect merchants:

Start tests on a limited traffic percentage

Continuously monitor performance signals

Automatically stop underperforming variants

Promote winning copy without waiting for manual input

At no point should testing risk store-wide performance.

📊 SMART SUCCESS SIGNALS (UPGRADE METRICS)

Do NOT rely only on clicks.

Evaluate variants using:

Time on product page

Scroll depth

Add-to-cart actions

Bounce behavior (if available)

Choose winners based on buyer intent, not vanity metrics.

⚙️ AUTO-APPLY + ROLLBACK INTEGRATION

When a winner is detected:

Apply the winning copy automatically

Register the change in Zyra’s existing Rollback system

Allow revert at:

Product level

Bulk test level

Do NOT create a new rollback mechanism.

🧠 STORE-WIDE LEARNING (MODERN VALUE)

Enhance the system so it:

Stores anonymized insights about what copy styles perform best

Uses these learnings to improve:

Future A/B tests

Default copy generation

Reduces testing time over time

This learning must stay internal and automatic.

🖥️ USER EXPERIENCE RULES

No manual copy editing

No prompt fields

Clear status indicators:

“Testing in progress”

“Winner selected”

Rollback always visible

Works for single products and bulk testing

🚫 HARD CONSTRAINTS (DO NOT CHANGE)

Do NOT add ranking or revenue guarantees

Do NOT require ads or paid traffic

Do NOT expose raw metrics that confuse users

Do NOT duplicate SEO Engine functionality

Shopify App Store–safe language only

📌 UPDATED FEATURE DESCRIPTION (REPLACE OLD TEXT)

A/B Testing Copy automatically tests different product copy strategies, keeps the better-performing version, and protects every change with rollback—no manual work required.

🔑 INTERNAL UPDATE PRINCIPLE

Testing should feel invisible, safe, and intelligent—not experimental.
