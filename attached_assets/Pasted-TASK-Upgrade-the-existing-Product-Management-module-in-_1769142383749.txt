TASK:
Upgrade the existing Product Management module in ZYRA AI to align with
the ONE-MODULE LOOP system (DETECT → DECIDE → EXECUTE → PROVE → LEARN)
and make it significantly more valuable than standard Shopify product dashboards.

The Product Management module must become a
“Product Revenue Intelligence & Control System”,
not a product editor or inventory tool.

================================================
CORE PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
================================================

1. Merchants must NOT manually edit products.
2. Product Management is for supervision, trust, and revenue visibility.
3. Every product must show how ZYRA is protecting, optimizing,
   and contributing revenue to it.
4. Removing ZYRA must feel like losing product-level intelligence forever.

================================================
KEEP EXISTING FEATURES (DO NOT REMOVE)
================================================

- Product sync function
- Push / publish function
- Total products count
- Synced products count
- Optimized products count
- Product cards with:
  • Image
  • Name
  • Category
  • Price

================================================
ADD NEW INTELLIGENCE LAYERS (MANDATORY)
================================================

------------------------------------------------
1. PRODUCT REVENUE HEALTH SCORE
------------------------------------------------

For every product, calculate and display:

Revenue Health Score (0–100)

Score must be AI-generated using:
- Conversion rate vs category average
- Traffic vs revenue mismatch
- SEO decay signals
- Cart abandonment involvement
- Upsell contribution
- Historical ZYRA success on this product

UI:
- Display score prominently on product card
- Color-coded:
  • Green (Healthy)
  • Yellow (At Risk)
  • Red (Revenue Leak)

Purpose:
Instantly show which products are safe, risky, or leaking money.

------------------------------------------------
2. ZYRA PROTECTION STATUS (FEAR-OF-LOSS LAYER)
------------------------------------------------

Each product must show one of three statuses:

- 🟢 ZYRA Protecting
- 🟡 ZYRA Monitoring
- 🔴 ZYRA Not Active

Tooltip text:
“Without ZYRA, this product will stop auto-optimizing and revenue monitoring.”

Purpose:
Make ZYRA’s role visible and irreplaceable.

------------------------------------------------
3. REVENUE ADDED BY ZYRA (PER PRODUCT)
------------------------------------------------

Add a column or badge:

“Revenue Added by ZYRA”

Value:
- Absolute revenue amount (+$ / ₹)
- Based only on proven attribution

Rules:
- Must show 0 for new products
- Must never exaggerate

Purpose:
Clear proof of value and retention anchor.

------------------------------------------------
4. PRODUCT ACTION HISTORY (MEMORY MOAT)
------------------------------------------------

Each product must have a locked, read-only timeline:

Example:
- Jan 10 → SEO optimized → Expected +$180 → Actual +$147
- Jan 22 → Content refreshed → +$90
- Feb 02 → Monitoring → Stable

Rules:
- Cannot be edited or exported
- Tied to ZYRA’s learning loop

Purpose:
Switching tools resets this history → high switching cost.

------------------------------------------------
5. PRODUCT CONFIDENCE INDEX
------------------------------------------------

Display:
“ZYRA Confidence: XX% ↑ / ↓”

Meaning:
How confident ZYRA is in future decisions for this product,
based on historical outcomes.

Rules:
- Confidence must change over time
- Confidence resets if ZYRA is removed

Purpose:
Make learning tangible and irreplaceable.

------------------------------------------------
6. AUTONOMY CONTROL (PLAN-BASED)
------------------------------------------------

Per product autonomy setting:

- Manual approval required
- Auto-run low-risk actions
- Full autonomy

Rules:
- Starter+ → Manual only
- Growth → Partial autonomy
- Scale → Full autonomy

Purpose:
Natural upgrade pressure without marketing.

================================================
PRODUCT PAGE STRUCTURE
================================================

Top Summary Bar:
- Total Products
- Revenue Protected by ZYRA ($)
- Products at Risk
- Products Fully Optimized

Product Cards:
- Image, Name, Category, Price
- Revenue Health Score
- ZYRA Protection Status
- Revenue Added by ZYRA
- Confidence %

Clicking a product opens:
- Action history
- Revenue proof
- Rollback button
- Autonomy control

================================================
WHAT MUST NOT BE ADDED
================================================

DO NOT add:
- Manual product editors
- SEO keyword tables
- Ranking charts
- Template editors
- CSV import/export
- Custom configurations

ZYRA must remain the operator, not the user.

================================================
INTEGRATION WITH LOOP
================================================

- DETECT: Revenue health scoring & risk detection
- DECIDE: Product-level decision logging
- EXECUTE: Auto-applied optimizations
- PROVE: Revenue added per product
- LEARN: Confidence index updates

================================================
OUTPUT EXPECTED
================================================

- Backend logic for scoring, confidence, attribution
- Frontend UI updates for product cards & details
- Plan-based autonomy enforcement
- Inline comments explaining how this builds
  trust, retention, and switching cost
