Optimize my entire application for ultra-fast performance with millisecond-level response. Apply the following improvements across all files, components, API routes, database queries, authentication, and UI rendering:

1. Core Speed Architecture

Implement full client-side caching, SSR, ISR, and edge functions wherever possible.

Reduce all API responses to < 200ms and UI interactions to < 16ms.

Add debounce + throttle logic to remove unnecessary re-renders.

Make UI transitions GPU-accelerated (transform, opacity).

2. Authentication (Login / Signup / Logout)

Optimize Supabase auth calls to resolve in < 100ms.

Preload auth state on app start.

Add instant feedback loaders + skeleton animation.

Prevent unnecessary page reloads and context refresh.

3. Buttons & Actions (Generate, Optimize, Sync, Pay, Upload)

Add async micro-state updates for instant feel (optimistic updates).

Reduce blocking operations.

Make all button actions execute with:

Preloading

Prefetching

Deferred transitions

Web workers for heavy AI tasks

4. UI Rendering Optimization

Remove unused components, CSS, imports.

Convert heavy components to lazy-loaded modules.

Use React Server Components where possible.

Preload all main UI layouts + cards for seamless navigation.

Add Zyra Cyberwave theme with smooth 120fps animations.

5. State Management & Caching

Use TanStack Query / Zustand for ultra-fast client state.

Cache API responses locally and invalidate smartly.

Add SWR fallback and realtime updates.

6. Supabase Database Optimization

Add indexes for all high-frequency queries.

Reduce query payloads to minimal fields.

Enable row-level caching.

Optimize read/write latency for sub-100ms.

7. Payment System Optimization

Prefetch Stripe/PayPal/Shopify SDKs.

Use webhooks instead of polling.

Add instant “Processing…” micro-animations.

8. File Uploads / AI Calls

Move AI requests to background workers.

Compress images before upload.

Provide instant local preview for zero wait time.

9. Global Performance

Enable code splitting, tree shaking, bundle optimization.

Minimise layout shifts, repaints, and blocking scripts.

Preload fonts, icons, theme assets, and dashboards.

Add service worker for offline + faster repeat loads.

Deliver the optimized code, components, and folder structure.
Ensure every action feels instant.
Output only improved, production-level optimized code.
