NO BREAKING CHANGES.
NO REMOVALS.
NO REFACTORING.

────────────────────────────────────────────

SYSTEM IDENTITY UPDATE (REQUIRED)

Update ZYRA AI so it behaves as:
- An autonomous revenue optimization system
- NOT a chatbot
- NOT an analytics dashboard
- NOT an SEO tool
- NOT a recommendation engine

ZYRA NEVER gives advice.
ZYRA NEVER asks merchants what to do.
ZYRA NEVER guarantees results.

────────────────────────────────────────────

IMPLEMENT THIS SINGLE OPERATING LOOP ACROSS THE ENTIRE SYSTEM:

DETECT → DECIDE → EXECUTE → PROVE → LEARN → REPEAT

NO FEATURE, LOGIC, OR UI MAY EXIST OUTSIDE THIS LOOP.

────────────────────────────────────────────

DETECT (Revenue Signals Only)

Add logic to detect ONLY revenue-linked signals using existing synced data:
- High-traffic, low-conversion products
- Sudden product-level revenue drops
- Content correlated with revenue decline
- Visitor intent mismatch
- Demand quality waste (wrong visitors)

DO NOT use:
- CTR
- Engagement metrics
- Vanity analytics
- Generic SEO scoring

Detection runs continuously and consumes NO credits.

────────────────────────────────────────────

DECIDE (Autonomous & Conservative)

For each detected issue:
- Calculate a Revenue Priority Score using:
  - Estimated revenue impact
  - Confidence level
  - Execution safety

Rules:
- Select ONLY ONE product or very small product group at a time
- Select ONLY ONE action OR NO ACTION
- If confidence is below threshold → DO NOTHING
- NEVER bulk optimize products

────────────────────────────────────────────

EXECUTE (Safe & Reversible Only)

Allowed actions ONLY:
PRIMARY (Conversion First):
- Product title optimization
- Product description optimization
- Value framing improvements

SECONDARY (Demand Quality Control – Conditional):
- Meta title updates
- Meta description updates
- Product tag alignment

Meta & tag updates are allowed ONLY IF:
- Conversion optimization already applied
- Traffic exists but revenue per visitor is weak
- Language comes from previously proven converting copy

Execution rules:
- Always save before-state snapshot
- Apply changes atomically
- Auto-rollback on revenue loss
- Never delete merchant data
- Never block merchant access

────────────────────────────────────────────

PROVE (Money Only)

Measure outcomes ONLY using revenue data:
- Revenue before
- Revenue after
- Net revenue delta

Rules:
- Negative impact → rollback automatically
- Neutral → deprioritize pattern
- Positive → reinforce pattern

DO NOT show proxy metrics.
DO NOT claim guarantees.

────────────────────────────────────────────

LEARN (Store-Specific Intelligence)

Persist private store-specific learning:
- Language that converts
- Product sensitivity patterns
- Safe vs risky actions

Learning must be:
- Non-exportable
- Non-transferable
- Used only to improve future decisions

────────────────────────────────────────────

CREDIT SYSTEM (SAFETY)

Credits represent REVENUE DECISIONS, not usage.

Examples:
- $49 → 1,000 credits (Revenue Safety Net)
- $299 → 6,000 credits (Growth Insurance)
- $999 → 20,000 credits (Executive Decision Engine)

Rules:
- Credits consumed ONLY on execution
- Detection & rollback are free
- Credits exhausted → execution stops, detection continues

────────────────────────────────────────────

MERCHANT MANUAL CONTROLS (LIMITED)

Add ONLY these controls:
- Global ON / OFF
- Safe Mode (risk level)
- Product / collection exclusions
- Execution timing window
- Emergency rollback
- Credit visibility

DO NOT allow merchants to:
- Choose products
- Edit AI content
- Approve actions
- Tune AI logic
- Trigger execution

────────────────────────────────────────────

ADD A NEW READ-ONLY UI SCREEN (MANDATORY)

Name: “ZYRA at Work”

Requirements:
- Read-only
- No inputs
- No controls
- Live written narration with typing animation (ChatGPT-style)
- Shows:
  - Detecting revenue issues
  - Selecting product
  - Choosing action
  - Executing safely
  - Monitoring revenue
  - Rolling back if needed

This screen must make merchants feel ZYRA is actively working on their revenue.

────────────────────────────────────────────

FINAL ABSOLUTE RULES

- DO NOT TOUCH SHOPIFY AUTH
- DO NOT TOUCH SHOPIFY BILLING
- DO NOT TOUCH SHOPIFY SYNC
- DO NOT TOUCH SHOPIFY DATA MODELS
- DO NOT TOUCH REVIEW-APPROVED FLOWS

THIS UPDATE IS AI BEHAVIOR + UI VISIBILITY ONLY.

If unsure → DO NOTHING.
If confident → EXECUTE ONCE, MEASURE, LEARN.

ZYRA MUST FEEL LIKE:
“A QUIET, ALWAYS-ON REVENUE OPERATOR THAT MERCHANTS TRUST WITH REAL MONEY.”

EXECUTE THIS UPDATE AS A SINGLE COHESIVE CHANGE.
