Enable Managed App Pricing on your app. For each merchant, know their shop domain. On your “Upgrade with Shopify” button, send them to the Shopify Admin pricing page URL for your app. Key docs for this flow: Managed App Pricing – setup and behavior Plan selection (pricing) page URL Managed pricing – welcome links and behavior  Set up Managed Pricing 2. URL of the Shopify Admin pricing page for your app Shopify hosts a pricing / plan-selection page inside Admin for each app using Managed Pricing. The URL format is: text Copy 1 https://admin.shopify.com/store/{store_handle}/charges/{app_handle}/pricing_plans Where: store_handle → the shop’s handle without .myshopify.com If shop domain is awesome-store.myshopify.com, then store_handle is awesome-store. app_handle → from your shopify.app.toml and your app listing. Example: text Copy 1 https://admin.shopify.com/store/awesome-store/charges/your-app-handle/pricing_plans When the merchant visits this URL in their browser, they see Shopify’s own pricing page for your app where they can upgrade/downgrade plans. Reference: Redirect to the plan selection page Because your app is external, you can just send a normal browser redirect or have your button be a normal <a> link to that URL. 3. How to build your “Upgrade with Shopify” button (non-embedded) Step 1: Store each merchant’s shop domain During OAuth installation, Shopify sends shop as a query parameter to your app, something like: text Copy 1 https://your-app.com/auth/callback?shop=awesome-store.myshopify.com&code=... You should: Capture shop (e.g. awesome-store.myshopify.com) Store it in your database (one record per merchant/store) Associate it with the merchant’s account in your SaaS Step 2: Compute store_handle and pricing URL On your backend (Node, Laravel, Rails, etc.), you can create a helper: js Copy 1 2 3 4 5 6 function buildShopifyPricingUrl(shopDomain, appHandle) { // shopDomain: "awesome-store.myshopify.com" const storeHandle = shopDomain.replace(".myshopify.com", ""); return https://admin.shopify.com/store/${storeHandle}/charges/${appHandle}/pricing_plans; } You must use the same app handle that’s in your app config / Partner Dashboard: Docs: Managed app pricing – Plan selection page details Step 3: Add the “Upgrade with Shopify” button Option A – Pure frontend link (if you already know shop & app handle in the page) If your page already knows: merchant.shopDomain (e.g. from your database via API) APP_HANDLE (constant) You can render a simple anchor tag: html  <a href="https://admin.shopify.com/store/awesome-store/charges/your-app-handle/pricing_plans" > Upgrade with Shopify </a> In a dynamic template (e.g. React): jsx  const shopDomain = merchant.shopDomain; // "awesome-store.myshopify.com" const storeHandle = shopDomain.replace(".myshopify.com", ""); const appHandle = "your-app-handle"; const pricingUrl = https://admin.shopify.com/store/${storeHandle}/charges/${appHandle}/pricing_plans; export function PricingCard() { return ( <a href={pricingUrl}> Upgrade with Shopify </a> ); } Because your app is external, the link will open directly in the merchant’s browser—not inside an iframe. Option B – Redirect via your backend Sometimes you don’t want to compute the URL on the client. Instead: On your frontend, link to your own URL (e.g. /billing/upgrade). On your backend, look up the merchant’s shop in your DB. Build the Shopify pricing URL. Return a 302 redirect. Example in Node/Express: js  Assume you have some auth middleware that sets req.user app.get("/billing/upgrade", async (req, res) => { const userId = req.user.id; const merchant = await db.merchants.findByUser(userId); if (!merchant || !merchant.shopDomain) { return res.status(400).send("Shop not connected"); } const shopDomain = merchant.shopDomain; // e.g. "awesome-store.myshopify.com" const storeHandle = shopDomain.replace(".myshopify.com", ""); const appHandle = process.env.SHOPIFY_APP_HANDLE; // from your config const pricingUrl = https://admin.shopify.com/store/${storeHandle}/charges/${appHandle}/pricing_plans; return res.redirect(302, pricingUrl); }); Frontend button: html Copy 1 2 3 <a href="/billing/upgrade"> Upgrade with Shopify </a> That’s it. The browser will navigate from your SaaS to Shopify’s Admin pricing page. 4. Extra: “Welcome link” back to your external app Managed Pricing also supports welcome links: after the merchant finishes choosing a plan in Shopify Admin, Shopify can redirect them to a URL you control (for example, your external app dashboard). You configure this in the Partner Dashboard as a welcome link. Docs: Welcome links in Managed pricing For external apps, the welcome link is a full URL (like https://your-app.com/welcome). Shopify will append shop and charge_id params when redirecting the merchant to your app. This is usually where you: Confirm the new subscription status (via Admin API billing query or webhook). Show a “You’re on the Pro plan now” message in your external app. 5. Common issues to watch out for Wrong store handle Make sure you strip .myshopify.com and only keep the left part: js Copy 1 const storeHandle = shopDomain.replace(".myshopify.com", ""); Wrong app handle The app_handle must match exactly what’s in your app configuration (and visible in the app URL in Shopify). If it’s wrong, the pricing page URL will 404 or show the wrong app. Merchant not logged in If the merchant isn’t logged into Shopify in that browser, Shopify will first ask them to log in, then redirect to the pricing page. Draft apps + locale mismatch For draft apps in development, the pricing page can return 404 if the dev store and app listing are in different locales. See the Limitations section. Recap For a non-embedded (external) app: Enable and configure Managed App Pricing in Partner Dashboard. Save the shop domain for each merchant during OAuth. On “Upgrade with Shopify” click: Generate: text Copy 1 https://admin.shopify.com/store/{store_handle}/charges/{app_handle}/pricing_plans Redirect the browser or link directly to that URL. Optionally configure a welcome link so that after subscription, Shopify sends the merchant back to your external app with context.
