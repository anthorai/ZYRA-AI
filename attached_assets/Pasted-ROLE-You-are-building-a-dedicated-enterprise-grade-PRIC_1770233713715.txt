ROLE:
You are building a dedicated, enterprise-grade PRICING page for ZYRA AI.
This page must be SEPARATE from the main landing page.
Remove all pricing sections from the landing page and link to this page instead.

The goal of this page is:
• Transparency
• Trust
• Clear plan differentiation
• Zero confusion about what users get

No hype language.
No fake promises.
Everything must map to real ZYRA capabilities.

DESIGN PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
--------------------------------------------------
• Clean, enterprise SaaS layout
• Dark mode (match ZYRA Cyberwave theme)
• Strong hierarchy, not flashy
• Readable at a glance
• Works for founders, operators, and teams
• Pricing must feel “serious”, not salesy

--------------------------------------------------
PAGE STRUCTURE (TOP → BOTTOM)
--------------------------------------------------

SECTION 1: PAGE HERO (EXPLANATION FIRST, NOT PRICES)

Headline:
"Simple pricing, based on how much control you give ZYRA"

Subtext:
"ZYRA pricing is not based on store size or hype features.
Each plan unlocks a specific level of automation, safety, and intelligence."

Supporting bullets:
• No revenue guarantees
• No risky automation by default
• Upgrade or downgrade anytime
• One action per loop, always safe

SECTION 2: HOW PRICING WORKS (EDUCATION BLOCK)

Title:
"How ZYRA pricing actually works"

Content (short paragraphs, not bullets):
• ZYRA pricing is permission-based, not usage-based.
• Plans control what ZYRA is allowed to do inside your store.

🧱 Foundation = Trust & clarity  
🚀 Growth = Revenue optimization
