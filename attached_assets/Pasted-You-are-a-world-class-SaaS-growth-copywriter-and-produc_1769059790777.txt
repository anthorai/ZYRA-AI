You are a world-class SaaS growth copywriter and product marketer.
Your task is to redesign the landing page for ZYRA AI — an AI-powered
Shopify growth platform — to maximize merchant trust, clarity, and conversion.

ZYRA must be positioned like Klaviyo or other category-leading SaaS companies:
clean, professional, revenue-focused, and enterprise-grade.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT position ZYRA as multiple tools.
- Do NOT use words like “SEO tool”, “campaign builder”, or “analytics dashboard”.
- Do NOT promise guaranteed results.
- Do NOT include anything that violates Shopify App Store policies.
- Keep language professional, transparent, and merchant-friendly.

ZYRA must be presented as ONE intelligent system that runs a continuous revenue loop.

=====================================
HERO SECTION (ABOVE THE FOLD)
=====================================

Headline:
“Let AI Run Your Shopify Growth — With Full Control”

Subheadline:
“ZYRA automatically detects, fixes, and proves what’s blocking your store’s revenue — 
from product SEO to cart recovery — while you stay in control.”

Primary CTA:
“Start Free with Your Shopify Store”

Secondary CTA:
“See How ZYRA Works”

Trust Signals:
- Built for Shopify stores
- No code required
- Safe automation with approval & rollback

=====================================
PROBLEM SECTION (MERCHANT PAIN)
=====================================

Headline:
“Most Shopify Stores Don’t Fail — They Leak Revenue”

Explain clearly:
- Traffic doesn’t convert
- Products rank but don’t sell
- Carts get abandoned
- Upsell opportunities are missed
- Merchants rely on too many disconnected tools

Position this as:
• Complexity
• Guesswork
• Manual work
• No clear revenue proof

=====================================
THE ZYRA SOLUTION (ONE BRAIN)
=====================================

Headline:
“One AI System. One Revenue Loop.”

Explain ZYRA’s core loop visually and in simple language:

DETECT → DECIDE → EXECUTE → PROVE → LEARN

Explain each step in 1–2 lines:
- Detects revenue leaks automatically
- Decides the next best growth action
- Executes changes safely
- Proves real revenue impact (₹ / $)
- Learns and improves over time

Make it clear:
ZYRA does the work. Merchants supervise.

=====================================
WHAT ZYRA DOES (OUTCOMES, NOT TOOLS)
=====================================

Section title:
“What ZYRA Automatically Runs for Your Store”

List outcomes (NOT tools):

• Cart recovery actions to bring shoppers back  
• Post-purchase upsells to increase order value  
• Product SEO improvements that drive converting traffic  
• Bulk product optimizations when patterns repeat  
• Brand-consistent content updates  
• Smart content refresh when performance drops  
• Competitive SEO improvements (optional power mode)  

Each item should feel like an action ZYRA takes, not a feature the user configures.

=====================================
CONTROL & SAFETY (TRUST BUILDER)
=====================================

Headline:
“Automation You Can Trust”

Explain clearly:
- Manual approval by default
- Autonomy only when merchant allows
- Full visibility into every change
- One-click rollback anytime
- No silent actions

Reassure merchants:
ZYRA never changes your store without your control.

=====================================
REVENUE PROOF (KEY DIFFERENTIATOR)
=====================================

Headline:
“See Exactly What Changed — And What It Made”

Explain:
- ZYRA tracks real revenue impact
- Shows which product was changed
- Shows why the change was made
- Shows how much money it generated
- No vanity metrics, only business outcomes

Position this as:
“Not more dashboards — just clarity.”

=====================================
WHO ZYRA IS FOR
=====================================

Short sections:
- Solo founders who want AI to handle growth
- Growing brands replacing multiple tools
- Teams that want automation without losing control

=====================================
FINAL CTA
=====================================

Headline:
“Stop Managing Growth. Start Supervising It.”

CTA:
“Install ZYRA for Shopify”

Supporting text:
• No credit card required  
• Safe, reversible automation  
• Built for long-term growth  

=====================================
TONE & STYLE GUIDELINES
=====================================

- Clean
- Confident
- Calm
- Enterprise-ready
- No hype
- No guarantees
- No buzzword overload

ZYRA should feel like:
“An intelligent growth system I can trust with my store.”
