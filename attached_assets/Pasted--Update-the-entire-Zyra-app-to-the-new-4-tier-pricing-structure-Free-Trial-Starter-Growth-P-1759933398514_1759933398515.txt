### 🧠 STEP 2 — Update Global Constants

**File:** `/lib/constants/plans.ts`
**Action:** Replace existing constants with:

```ts
export const ZYRA_PLANS = {
  FREE: "plan_free_7day_001",
  STARTER: "plan_starter_002",
  GROWTH: "plan_growth_003",
  PRO: "plan_pro_004",
};

export const CREDIT_LIMITS = {
  [ZYRA_PLANS.FREE]: 100,
  [ZYRA_PLANS.STARTER]: 1000,
  [ZYRA_PLANS.GROWTH]: 5000,
  [ZYRA_PLANS.PRO]: 20000,
};
```

---

### 🎨 STEP 3 — Update UI Pricing Page

**Components to update:**

* `/components/pricing/PlanCard.tsx`
* `/components/pricing/PricingGrid.tsx`
* `/app/settings/subscription/page.tsx`

**Prompt for Cursor AI:**

> Refactor pricing UI to display new plan data dynamically from Supabase `plans` table using plan ID constants. Add credit badges, target description, and feature list with icons. Highlight active plan with gradient border (Neon Azure → Cyber Cyan). CTA button text: “Activate Plan” or “Upgrade”.

---

### ⚙️ STEP 4 — Credit Logic Update

**File:** `/lib/credits/useCredits.ts`
**Action:**

> Update credit consumption to deduct based on feature type and plan. Use feature-credit mapping from database. Add fail-safe check for available credits before executing AI feature.

---

### 🔒 STEP 5 — Feature Gating Update

**File:** `/lib/permissions/planFeatures.ts`
**Prompt for AI Dev:**

> Map features to plan IDs. Restrict advanced automation (AI Upsell, Multimodal AI, Behavioral Targeting) to Growth & Pro plans. Unlock Brand Voice Memory and Analytics tools for Starter and above.

---

### 📦 STEP 6 — API & Supabase Sync

* **Supabase Table:** `user_subscriptions`

  * `plan_id` → FK referencing `plans.id`
  * `credits_used` → track monthly usage
  * `renewal_date` → auto-update monthly

* **API Endpoint:** `/api/upgrade-plan`

  * Validate Stripe/Shopify subscription
  * Update `user_subscriptions.plan_id`
  * Reset monthly credits

---



> “Update Zyra’s entire pricing system (UI + backend + constants + credits logic + Supabase schema) using the new plans JSON above. Replace all old plan references with new plan IDs. Verify dynamic rendering on pricing, billing, and dashboard pages. Ensure credit deduction aligns with the new feature-credit mapping.”

---

### 💡 Notes

* Use color palette: `#00F0FF` (Neon Azure) + `#00FFE5` (Cyber Cyan)
* CTA buttons: “Start Free Trial”, “Upgrade to Starter”, “Scale with Growth”, “Power Up with Pro”
* Plan icons: use `lucide-react` icons (`Rocket`, `BarChart`, `Zap`, `Crown`)

---

**Result:**
After applying this prompt, Zyra’s pricing, credit, and feature management system will be fully updated, synchronized, and production-ready.
