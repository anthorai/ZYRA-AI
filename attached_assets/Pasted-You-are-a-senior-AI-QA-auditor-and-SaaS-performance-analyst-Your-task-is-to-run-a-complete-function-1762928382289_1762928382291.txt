You are a senior AI QA auditor and SaaS performance analyst.
Your task is to run a complete functional test and stability review of a Shopify-connected AI automation platform built for eCommerce and dropshipping.

The platform’s purpose: act as a Shopify sales-boosting autopilot — optimizing products, SEO, analytics, and content.

Objective: Verify that every existing function, feature, and AI tool is fully operational, accurate, and aligned with production-ready quality.
Do not suggest new integrations or features. Focus only on the functionality, logic, and performance of what’s already built.

🔍 1. Functional Verification

For each active feature, perform a validation test:

Shopify Store Connection:

Confirm stable store authentication, token validity, and product sync accuracy.

Test reconnection flow and session persistence.

Product Optimization Engine:

Verify AI improves product titles, descriptions, and tags without breaking data structure.

Check keyword density, formatting, and SEO compliance.

SEO Analyzer & Rank Booster:

Validate keyword tracking, density scoring, and meta-tag generation.

Ensure output follows current Shopify SEO best practices.

AI Content Generator:

Test copy generation for clarity, emotion, and conversion quality.

Check templates (ads, descriptions, emails) for tone and grammar.

Pricing & Profit Logic:

Verify algorithm correctness for profit margins, price adjustments, and alerts.

Ensure data reflects live synced store values.

Analytics & Insights Dashboard:

Confirm correct fetching of store stats, conversion data, and trend analysis.

Validate dashboard filters, charts, and metrics visibility.

Sales Booster Modules:

Test upsell, cross-sell, abandoned cart reminder flows.

Confirm triggers fire at correct events and data tracking is accurate.

Automation & Scheduling:

Verify tasks (SEO refresh, content rewrite, analytics scan) run as scheduled.

Confirm logs and notifications are generated correctly.

User Interface & Experience:

Test all buttons, modals, dropdowns, and pages for responsiveness.

Ensure dark mode (Cyberwave theme) visuals and UX are consistent.

Supabase Database Connectivity:

Confirm all reads/writes, user settings, and live data saving work correctly.

Check error handling and rollback logic.

🔄 2. Performance & Stability

Measure API latency, response time, and system load under multiple test users.

Check for memory leaks, error handling, and rate limit protection.

Validate background jobs, worker queues, and caching logic.

🧠 3. AI Logic & Output Quality

Evaluate the consistency, relevance, and quality of generated outputs.

Run 5 sample tests per module (SEO, content, pricing, analytics).

Detect repetitive phrasing, irrelevant text, or outdated patterns.

🔐 4. Security & Compliance

Confirm all API keys and tokens are encrypted.

Validate OAuth flows, user sessions, and logout handling.

Test data privacy according to GDPR and Shopify Partner guidelines.

📋 5. Report & Roadmap Output

Generate a comprehensive test report including:

✅ Passed Modules

⚠️ Minor Issues

❌ Critical Errors

💡 Suggested Fix or Logic Adjustment (within existing scope only)

Format output as a checklist table with results + recommendations.

Final Goal:
Certify that the Zyra AI system is market-ready, stable, accurate, and intelligent — functioning as a Shopify sales autopilot that truly boosts performance, content quality, and sales conversion for eCommerce and dropshipping businesses.
