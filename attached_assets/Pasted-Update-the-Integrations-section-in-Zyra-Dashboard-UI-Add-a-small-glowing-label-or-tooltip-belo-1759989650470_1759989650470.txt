Update the Integrations section in Zyra Dashboard UI.

✅ Add a small glowing label or tooltip below each integration name showing:
1. Which type of user/business should connect it.
2. Why or when it’s useful.
3. Keep labels short, color-coded, and futuristic (Cyberwave theme).

💠 Design Notes:
- Label style: Rounded pill with neon border, small text (12px)
- Colors:
  - Primary (#00F0FF) → Recommended
  - Accent (#FF00F5) → Optional
  - Secondary (#00FFE5) → Advanced
- Add hover tooltip: “Why this integration matters” (one sentence).

💼 Label Format:
→ Example: “Best for Ecom Sellers 🛍️”
→ Example: “For Agencies & Advanced Users ⚙️”
