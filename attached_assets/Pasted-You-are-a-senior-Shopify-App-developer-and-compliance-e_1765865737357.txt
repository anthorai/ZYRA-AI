You are a senior Shopify App developer and compliance expert.

TASK: Update the Zyra AI Shopify app to fully comply with Shopify App Store billing and content policies.

BILLING & PRICING (CRITICAL):
1. Remove ALL off-platform payment systems completely:
   - Remove Stripe, Razorpay, PayPal, manual payments, invoices, and any external checkout pages.
   - Remove any references, SDKs, UI buttons, logos, or environment variables related to external payments.

2. Implement Shopify Managed Pricing ONLY:
   - Use pricing plans created inside the Shopify Partner Dashboard.
   - Do NOT create any custom checkout or pricing URLs.
   - Ensure all charges are handled by Shopify billing only.

3. Upgrade Flow:
   - Replace all “Buy Now”, “Pay Now”, or “Upgrade” actions with a single button labeled:
     “Upgrade via Shopify”
   - When clicked, redirect the merchant to the Shopify billing confirmation screen using Shopify’s billing request flow.
   - Do NOT hardcode any Shopify pricing page URL.
   - If the merchant already has an active plan, redirect back to the app dashboard.

4. Billing Logic:
   - On app load, check if the merchant has an active Shopify subscription.
   - If no active subscription exists, block premium features and redirect to the Shopify billing screen.
   - After successful approval, unlock features based on the subscribed plan.

5. Credits / Usage:
   - Keep the internal credit or usage limit system.
   - Treat credits strictly as a usage allowance, NOT as a purchasable item.
   - Reset usage allowances on each Shopify billing cycle.
   - Remove any “Buy credits” or “Top-up credits” language.

CONTENT & CLAIMS (SHOPIFY POLICY 4.3.4):
6. Remove ALL guarantees, statistics, and superlative claims from:
   - Landing pages
   - App UI
   - App Store listing
   - Images, banners, badges, and marketing sections

7. Specifically remove or rewrite:
   - Percentages (e.g., “300%”, “85%”)
   - Time claims (e.g., “10 min setup”)
   - Words like: “best”, “#1”, “guaranteed”, “proven”, “boosts sales”, “increase revenue”

8. Replace claims with neutral, capability-based language only.
   Examples:
   - ❌ “300% Sales Increase”
   - ✅ “Tools to help optimize product content and storefront performance”





FINAL CHECK:
11. Ensure there is no remaining reference to:
   - External payments
   - Guarantees or statistical claims
   - Off-platform billing

The final result must be 100% compliant with Shopify Managed Pricing and App Store review requirements.
