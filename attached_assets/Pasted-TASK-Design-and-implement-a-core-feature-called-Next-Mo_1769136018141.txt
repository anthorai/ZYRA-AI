TASK:
Design and implement a core feature called “Next Move” for ZYRA AI.

GOAL:
“Next Move” must help merchants make MORE MONEY by allowing ZYRA
to take ownership of the next best revenue decision and execute it
with minimal human involvement.

Merchants must NEVER perform manual work.
ZYRA prepares and executes everything.
Humans only approve, monitor, or rollback.

================================================
CORE CONCEPT
================================================

“Next Move” is NOT a tool, NOT a task list, and NOT a suggestion feed.

It is:
- A single, authoritative revenue decision made by ZYRA
- The visible control surface of ZYRA’s revenue loop
- Always ONE action at a time

If more than one action is shown, the feature is wrong.

================================================
LOOP ENFORCEMENT (MANDATORY)
================================================

Every “Next Move” MUST follow:

DETECT → DECIDE → EXECUTE → PROVE → LEARN

If an action cannot be proven in revenue, it must NOT become a Next Move.

================================================
BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION
================================================

1. NEXT MOVE DECISION ENGINE

Build a service that continuously evaluates all detected opportunities
and selects exactly ONE action using this formula:

NextMoveScore =
(Expected_Revenue_Impact × Confidence_Score) ÷ Risk_Level

Inputs may include:
- Product traffic vs conversion rate
- Abandoned cart volume
- Revenue per SKU
- SEO decay signals
- Upsell performance history
- Past ZYRA action outcomes
- Plan limitations
- Available credits

Only the highest-scoring action becomes the active Next Move.
All others remain queued internally and invisible.

------------------------------------------------

2. NEXT MOVE DATA MODEL

Create a persistent data structure:

- next_move_id
- action_type
  (product_seo, cart_recovery, upsell, rollback, refresh)
- product_id (nullable)
- reason (plain-language explanation)
- expected_revenue
- confidence_score (0–100)
- risk_level (low / medium / high)
- status
  (ready | awaiting_approval | executing | monitoring | completed)
- plan_required
- credit_cost
- created_at
- executed_at
- completed_at

------------------------------------------------

3. PLAN-BASED EXECUTION RULES

Starter+ ($49 | 1000 credits):
- ZYRA prepares the Next Move
- ALWAYS requires approval
- Only very low-risk auto-actions allowed
- Limited SERP depth
- Standard execution speed

Growth ($249 | 6000 credits):
- Auto-run low-risk Next Moves
- Medium-risk requires approval
- Standard SERP depth
- Faster execution

Scale ($499 | 15000 credits):
- Auto-run most Next Moves
- Approval only for high-risk actions
- Advanced SERP depth
- Priority execution

Execution MUST stop if:
- Credits are insufficient
- Plan does not allow the action

------------------------------------------------

4. CREDIT MANAGEMENT

- Each Next Move consumes credits BEFORE execution
- Credit cost scales with:
  • Action type
  • SERP depth
  • Bulk size
- If credits are low:
  • Prioritize highest ROI action
  • Show soft messaging (no hard blocks)

------------------------------------------------

5. EXECUTION & SAFETY

Before execution:
- ZYRA must generate the full change (SEO, copy, logic)
- Create a rollback snapshot

After execution:
- Monitor revenue impact
- Allow instant rollback
- Auto-rollback if revenue drops significantly (optional for Scale)

------------------------------------------------

6. LEARNING LOOP

After completion:
- Compare expected vs actual revenue
- Adjust confidence scoring
- Feed result into future Next Move decisions
- Improve prioritization over time

================================================
FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION
================================================

1. SIDEBAR NAVIGATION

Add a new sidebar item:

🧠 Next Move

Sidebar order:
- Next Move
- ZYRA At Work
- Products
- Settings

------------------------------------------------

2. NEXT MOVE PAGE UI (STRICT RULES)

The page must show ONE hero card only.

Example structure:

Title:
🧠 Next Best Revenue Move

Content:
- Action name
- Product name (if applicable)
- Why ZYRA chose this
- Expected revenue impact (₹ / $)
- Confidence score
- Risk level
- Rollback guarantee

Buttons (plan-aware):
- Starter+: “Approve & Run”
- Growth: “Run Automatically” OR “Approve”
- Scale: Auto-executes, button shows status only

------------------------------------------------

3. UX RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

DO NOT:
- Show multiple suggestions
- Show configuration options
- Show analytics charts
- Show editable text fields
- Ask the merchant to do work

ALWAYS:
- Use decisive language
- Show revenue impact
- Show safety & rollback
- Make execution feel immediate

------------------------------------------------

4. STATUS FLOW

The UI must update live:

Ready → Executing → Monitoring → Proved

Once completed:
- Automatically generate the next Next Move

------------------------------------------------

5. LANGUAGE RULES

Never say:
- “You should do this”
- “Configure”
- “Edit”
- “Create”

Always say:
- “ZYRA detected…”
- “ZYRA decided…”
- “ZYRA optimized…”

================================================
INTEGRATION RULES
================================================

- Executed Next Moves must appear in “ZYRA At Work”
- Rollback must be accessible from both pages
- Product-related moves must link to product status
- Settings only control autonomy levels, never actions

================================================
OUTPUT EXPECTED
================================================

- Backend Next Move decision engine
- Plan-aware execution enforcement
- Credit deduction logic
- Frontend Next Move page UI
- Clear inline comments explaining logic
