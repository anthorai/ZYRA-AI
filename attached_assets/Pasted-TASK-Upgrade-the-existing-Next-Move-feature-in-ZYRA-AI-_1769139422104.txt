TASK:
Upgrade the existing “Next Move” feature in ZYRA AI into a
high-trust, enterprise-grade Revenue Decision Engine.

The goal is to make “Next Move” feel:
- Powerful (AI owns the decision)
- Trustworthy (clear reasoning + safety)
- Valuable (obvious revenue upside)
- Unbeatable (features competitors don’t have)

================================================
CORE PRINCIPLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
================================================

“Next Move” is NOT a suggestion.

It is:
- A revenue decision ZYRA has already made
- Backed by data, reasoning, and prediction
- Executable with one click
- Fully reversible if it fails

Merchants NEVER perform manual work.
They only approve, monitor, or rollback.

================================================
NEXT MOVE v2 — REQUIRED UPGRADE LAYERS
================================================

Add THREE intelligence layers to the existing Next Move card
WITHOUT adding complexity or more buttons.

------------------------------------------------
LAYER 1: DECISION TRANSPARENCY (WHY THIS MOVE)
------------------------------------------------

Add a collapsible section titled:

“Why ZYRA chose this move”

This section must explain the decision in plain language.
No charts. No jargon.

Example bullets:
- Purchase patterns show Product A → Product B correlation
- 38% of buyers viewed both products
- Similar stores increased AOV by 14–19%
- ZYRA confidence increased after recent wins

RULES:
- This section is collapsed by default
- Expands on click
- Builds trust without giving control

------------------------------------------------
LAYER 2: OPPORTUNITY COST (WHAT IF YOU DO NOTHING)
------------------------------------------------

Add a small but visible line:

“If skipped, estimated revenue left on table this month: $X”

RULES:
- Must be based on real projections
- Must update dynamically
- Must never exaggerate

PURPOSE:
This reframes the decision from:
“Should I run this?”
to
“I’m losing money if I don’t.”

------------------------------------------------
LAYER 3: REVERSIBLE COMMITMENT (SAFETY PROMISE)
------------------------------------------------

Upgrade “Rollback Guarantee” into a promise:

“ZYRA will automatically undo this if revenue drops.”

RULES:
- This is a SYSTEM GUARANTEE, not a tooltip
- Rollback snapshot must be created before execution
- Rollback must be one-click and instant

This removes fear and makes one-click execution acceptable.

================================================
UPDATED NEXT MOVE CARD STRUCTURE
================================================

The page must still show ONLY ONE card.

Structure:

Title:
🧠 Next Best Revenue Move

Primary Info:
- Action name
- Product name (if applicable)
- Expected revenue impact ($ / ₹)
- Confidence score (%)
- Risk level (Low / Medium / High)

Middle (collapsed by default):
- Why ZYRA chose this move
- What happens if skipped

Bottom:
- Approve & Run (Starter+)
- Auto-run toggle / status (Growth / Scale)
- Rollback promise text

NO additional configuration.
NO secondary actions.

================================================
PLAN-AWARE BEHAVIOR
================================================

Starter+:
- Always shows “Approve & Run”
- Emphasize safety + rollback
- No auto-execution

Growth:
- Auto-run low-risk moves
- Approval required for medium-risk
- Show reduced explanation text

Scale:
- Auto-run by default
- Next Move page becomes informational
- Emphasis on monitoring & proof

================================================
CREDIT JUSTIFICATION (IMPORTANT)
================================================

When showing credit cost, always pair it with value:

Example:
“Action cost: 350 credits
Estimated return: $1,250
≈ $3.57 per credit”

This reframes credits as:
Growth fuel, not a limitation.

================================================
LANGUAGE RULES
================================================

DO NOT use:
- Suggestion
- Recommendation
- Configure
- Edit
- Tool

ALWAYS use:
- ZYRA detected
- ZYRA decided
- ZYRA will execute
- ZYRA will rollback if needed

================================================
INTEGRATION RULES
================================================

- Executed Next Moves must appear in “ZYRA At Work”
- Rollback available from both pages
- Completion must trigger learning update
- Next Move must auto-refresh after completion

================================================
OUTPUT EXPECTED
================================================

- Updated Next Move UI logic
- Backend support for reasoning + opportunity cost
- Rollback promise enforcement
- Plan-aware behavior
- Inline comments explaining why this design builds trust
