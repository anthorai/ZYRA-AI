Functional Flow:

6. Custom Templates (Edit)

What it does: Let merchants create and save AI-generated templates.

Functional Flow:

Merchants can apply template to any campaign card.

7. Behavioral Triggers (Setup)

What it does: Fire campaigns based on user behavior.

Functional Flow:

On Setup → define triggers like:

“If user views product 3 times → send discount SMS.”

“If cart value > $200 → offer free shipping upsell.”

AI suggests best triggers based on analytics.

System auto-executes when conditions match.

🔹 Technical Implementation Plan

Frontend (React/Next.js)

Each card’s button routes to a dedicated page or modal (/campaigns/upsell, /campaigns/sms, etc.).

State management (Redux / Zustand) to track enable/disable status.

Backend (Node.js / Express / NestJS)

Campaign APIs:

/api/campaigns/upsell

/api/campaigns/sms

/api/campaigns/templates

AI calls → OpenAI / fine-tuned model.

Shopify API integration (products, carts, orders, customers).

Database (Postgres / MongoDB)

Store campaign configs, templates, AI outputs, analytics results.

Execution Engine

Cron jobs / event listeners (Shopify webhooks: cart abandoned, order placed).

Fire triggers automatically.

✅ In short: Every card’s button should lead to a real workflow → setup, edit, generate, or view analytics → connect with Shopify API + AI outputs → and store results in your Zyra backend.
