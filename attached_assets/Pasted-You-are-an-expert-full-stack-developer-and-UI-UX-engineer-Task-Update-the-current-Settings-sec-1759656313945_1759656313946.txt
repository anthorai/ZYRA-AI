You are an expert full-stack developer and UI/UX engineer.

Task:
Update the current Settings section of the application.

Objective:
Remove the existing popup/modal window behavior for the following cards:
1. AI Preferences  
2. Notifications & Alerts  
3. Integrations  
4. Security  
5. Support & Resources  

→ Instead of opening a popup on click, each card should now open a **dedicated page** with its own route and component.

Requirements:

1. Delete:
   - All current popup or dialog-related logic and components linked to these cards.
   - Any modal state or overlay rendering related to Settings cards.

2. Add:
   - Separate pages/components for each card:
     - `/settings/ai-preferences`
     - `/settings/notifications`
     - `/settings/integrations`
     - `/settings/security`
     - `/settings/support`

3. Navigation Logic:
   - When a user clicks a card, it should navigate to the correct page using client-side routing (`next/link` or `useRouter.push()`).
   - The transition should be smooth with a fade or slide effect between pages.

4. Page Structure:
   Each page must include:
   - A top header displaying the page title (e.g., “AI Preferences”).
   - A short description under the header explaining the page purpose.
   - A main content section displaying mock UI elements or real features:
     - **AI Preferences:** toggles, dropdowns, and sliders for model selection, tone, and performance.  
     - **Notifications & Alerts:** switches for enabling or snoozing alerts, alert categories list.  
     - **Integrations:** API keys, connected apps, “Connect” and “Disconnect” buttons.  
     - **Security:** password update, 2FA toggle, session device list.  
     - **Support & Resources:** help links, documentation, and contact support form mock.  
   - A back navigation button or breadcrumb to return to the main Settings page.

5. Component Design:
   - Use a clean, responsive layout consistent with the current app UI.
   - Each page should reuse the same header and footer components for consistency.
   - Ensure proper spacing and structure for readability.

6. File & Folder Structure:
   Inside `/app/settings/` (or `/pages/settings/` depending on your setup), create:
