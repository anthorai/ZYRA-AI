This error message, "The script has an unsupported MIME type ('text/html')", indicates that the browser attempted to load a script resource, but the server responded with a Content-Type: text/html header instead of an expected script MIME type like application/javascript or text/javascript. This usually means that the URL specified in your <script> tag either points to an HTML document (like an error page, a redirect, or the main index.html) or the server is misconfigured and serving JavaScript files with the wrong Content-Type header. The browser, expecting executable JavaScript, refuses to execute HTML content for security reasons and to prevent unexpected behavior. The error SecurityError: Failed to register a ServiceWorker for scope ('https://zzyraai.com/') with script ('https://zzyraai.com/sw.js'): The script has an unsupported MIME type ('text/html') indicates that the browser attempted to register a Service Worker, but the file served at https://zzyraai.com/sw.js was returned with a text/html MIME type instead of a JavaScript MIME type (like application/javascript or text/javascript). Browsers enforce strict MIME type checking for Service Worker scripts to prevent security vulnerabilities, as Service Workers have powerful capabilities. This usually happens when the sw.js file either doesn't exist at the specified path, or the server is misconfigured and serves an HTML error page (like a 404 Not Found page) with a text/html MIME type when the JavaScript file is requested.The console message "Manifest: Line: 1, column: 1, Syntax error." indicates that your browser encountered an issue parsing your web app manifest file (typically manifest.json) right from its very beginning. This often means the file is not valid JSON, is empty, or contains invalid characters at its start, preventing the browser from interpreting its content correctly. The manifest file is crucial for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) as it defines metadata like the app's name, icons, start URL, and display mode.
