TASK:
Implement subscription plans, plan-based access control, and monthly credit limits
for ZYRA AI across both backend and frontend.

GOAL:
ZYRA must change its behavior, autonomy level, feature access, and credit usage
based on the user’s active subscription plan:
Starter+, Growth, or Scale.

Plans must FEEL different in real usage, not just in text.

================================================
SUBSCRIPTION PLANS (FINAL)
================================================

Starter+ ($49/month)
- Monthly Credits: 1000
- Autonomy: Very Low
- Execution Speed: Standard

Growth ($249/month)
- Monthly Credits: 6000
- Autonomy: Medium
- Execution Speed: Fast

Scale ($499/month)
- Monthly Credits: 15000
- Autonomy: High
- Execution Speed: Priority

================================================
BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION (REQUIRED)
================================================

1. Create a subscription plan model with:
   - plan_name (starter_plus | growth | scale)
   - monthly_credits
   - autonomy_level (low | medium | high)
   - execution_priority (standard | fast | priority)

2. Create a user subscription table that stores:
   - user_id
   - active_plan
   - credits_remaining
   - credits_reset_date (monthly)
   - plan_started_at

3. Implement a CREDIT MANAGER:
   - Deduct credits on every AI action
   - Prevent execution if credits are insufficient
   - Allow actions to proceed only if plan allows it
   - Reset credits automatically every billing cycle

4. Enforce PLAN RULES AT RUNTIME:
   - Starter+:
     • Manual approval required for most actions
     • Allow only very low-risk auto-actions
     • Single-product optimization
     • Limited SERP analysis depth
   - Growth:
     • Auto-run low-risk actions
     • Bulk optimization allowed
     • Standard SERP analysis depth
   - Scale:
     • High autonomy
     • Advanced SERP analysis
     • Large bulk actions
     • Priority execution

5. NEVER rely on frontend checks alone.
   All plan and credit enforcement must be validated server-side.

================================================
FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION (REQUIRED)
================================================

1. Display the ACTIVE PLAN clearly:
   - Plan name
   - Credits remaining
   - Monthly reset date

2. Show CREDIT USAGE LIVE:
   - Deduct credits visually when ZYRA executes actions
   - Show “credits used” per action in ZYRA At Work

3. PLAN-AWARE EXPERIENCE:
   - Starter+:
     • Show more approval modals
     • Language: “Prepared by ZYRA – Approval Required”
   - Growth:
     • Some actions auto-run
     • Tag actions: “Auto-applied by ZYRA”
   - Scale:
     • Most actions auto-run
     • Minimal interruptions
     • Focus UI on revenue totals

4. DO NOT:
   - Show disabled buttons
   - Show “Upgrade required” popups
   - Block UI actions silently

5. INSTEAD:
   - Show soft upgrade nudges like:
     “ZYRA could automate this safely”
     “Higher plans unlock faster execution”

================================================
CREDIT CONSUMPTION RULES
================================================

- Credits are consumed per AI action
- Larger actions (bulk, SERP analysis) consume more credits
- Credits must be checked BEFORE execution
- If credits are low:
  - ZYRA should prioritize highest revenue-impact actions
  - Suggest waiting for reset or upgrading (soft message)

================================================
OUTPUT EXPECTED
================================================

- Backend models / services for plans & credits
- Middleware or guards enforcing plan access
- Frontend state handling for plan-aware UI
- Clear inline comments explaining plan differences
